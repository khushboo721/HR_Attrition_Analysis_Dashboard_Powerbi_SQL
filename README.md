# HR_Attrition_Analysis_Dashboard_Powerbi_SQL

###  Overview  
This project analyzes **employee attrition trends** for a tech service company named **TechIT Solutions**, which has a workforce of around 10,000 employees.  
The goal was to understand the key drivers behind increasing employee turnover and provide data-driven insights for improving retention and workforce stability.

Using **Power BI** and **SQL**, the dashboard highlights metrics such as attrition rate, job satisfaction, overtime, business travel, and work-life balance, empowering HR leaders to make informed and targeted decisions.


## Business Background  
TechIT Solutions noticed rising employee turnover that was impacting **project delivery** and **team stability**.  
There was no visibility into:
- Which departments or roles were most affected  
- What factors were driving attrition  
- How company policies (e.g., travel, overtime) were influencing turnover  

The HR department needed a structured analytics solution to identify problem areas and improve employee retention through actionable insights.


## Problem Statement  
Despite having a large workforce, the company lacked clear visibility into:
1. **Departments or roles** most affected by attrition.  
2. **Key drivers** such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and travel frequency.  
3. **Policy impact** on attrition (e.g., overtime, salary hikes, and promotions).

These gaps caused:
- High recruitment and training costs.  
- Frequent project disruptions.  
- Generic HR policies with minimal impact.

## Objectives  
- Identify and visualize **attrition drivers** across departments and roles.  
- Analyze the correlation between **job satisfaction**, **overtime**, and **attrition rate**.  
- Provide HR and management with **data-backed insights** for retention strategies. 

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Microsoft Excel** - Cleaned and validated raw HR data for accuracy and consistency.
- **SQL Server (SSMS)** - Created tables, inserted data, and performed transformations using SQL queries.
- **Power BI Desktop** - Connected to SQL for visualization, built DAX measures, and designed an interactive dashboard to uncover attrition insights.
